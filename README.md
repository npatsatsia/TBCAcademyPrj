## TECHNOLOGIES USED:
  - **HTML5**: Used for structuring the content and layout of the web page.
  - **CSS3**: Applied for styling and presentation of the web page.
  - **JavaScript (ES6)**: Used for adding dynamic behavior and interactivity to the web page.


  

## PROJECT STRUCTURE:

  1. **HTML Files:**
      - `index.html`: Includes essential meta tags, linked external resources.
      - Also the approach of using separate HTML files for each component and rendering content dynamically through JavaScript.
  2. **CSS Files:**
      - `styles.css`: The main CSS file contains a global reset for margin and padding, a set of CSS variables defined in :root, and some styling rules for the body, header, section, and footer.
                 - For each component, I've created a dedicated CSS file where I define the styling specific to that section, outlining how each part should appear.  3. JavaScript Files

  3. **JS Files:**
       - `main.js`: The main JavaScript file, importing different components/modules that represent different sections of your web application. Each import statement corresponds to a specific section.
               - DOM Manipulation, creating instances of components, appending the different sections of the web application and rendering components.
               - For each component, I've created a corresponding JS file to manage the logic, outlining how each section should function.
     
  4. **Assets:**
         - `images/`: Contains image files, logos, background image, and static images used in the application.
         - main.js and styles.css files are also placed here

  5. **Static:**
         - Centralized Asset Management in static.js file, which serves as a hub for managing and importing static resources, particularly images, .map function allows us to seamlessly integrate these images into our components
         - also it has bennefits such as maintainability and Ease of Update.

  5. **Access Project in Browser:**
     - Copy the provided URL and open a web browser.
  
  6. **Keep Terminal Open:**
     - Remember to keep the terminal window open while the server is running. Closing the terminal will stop the server.
  
  7. **Stop the Server (Optional):**
     - To manually stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window.

By following these steps, you should be able to launch your project using the `http-server` and access it in your web browser. This setup is convenient for development purposes.



### Useing Live Server

  1. **Install Visual Studio Code:**
     - Ensure that you have Visual Studio Code installed on your machine.
  
  2. **Open Project in Visual Studio Code:**
     - Open your project folder using Visual Studio Code.
  
  3. **Install Live Server Extension:**
     - Install the "Live Server" extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
  
  4. **Right-click on `index.html`:**
     - In the Visual Studio Code file explorer, right-click on your `index.html` file.
  
  5. **Select "Open with Live Server":**
     - Choose the option "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.
  
  6. **Access Project in Browser:**
     - Your default web browser will open, and your project will be accessible at a live server address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5500).
  
  7. **Keep Visual Studio Code Open:**
     - You can continue editing your code in Visual Studio Code while the live server is running.
  
  8. **Stop Live Server (Optional):**
     - To stop the live server, right-click on the Visual Studio Code window and choose "Stop Server" from the Live Server menu.

By following these steps, you should be able to launch your project using Visual Studio Code's Live Server extension. This extension simplifies the process of starting a local server for your project.
